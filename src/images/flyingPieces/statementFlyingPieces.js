  "It is curious that when an author describes romantic love, it is frequently expressed with a certain amount of pain. Even when requited, words like- 'excruciating,' 'desperate' and 'unbearable' frequently figure into things. Falling in love is often described as an all-consuming, sweaty, slightly nauseous, and disorienting business. But it is a positive pain. One might think that the language used to describe the loss of that love would be quite different. However, given a new context the same words can easily convey the agony of heartbreak.",
  "These five images were created with lines from a handful of love letters and poems I received from a lover who later left. At the start of the series,the image is in keeping with the positive context in which the words were given. But quickly as the series develops, the photographs and words are reimagined; expressing what could be read as either a positive or negative pain. But by the end, it  simply displays loss and the crippling type of pain that comes with heartbreak.",
  "The photographs were shot alone on a timer and the overlaid words are still in the writer's hand from the original letters. While obviously deeply personal, the work attempts to explore the duality of words and the ambiguity of love, longing, and loss.",
